# Future Design Ideas
## Near-term Priorities

## Core Mechanics & Resources
- **Tool Generation & Degradation:** Introduce tools that enhance efficiency but degrade over time, requiring replacement or repair.
- **Disaggregated Food Resources:** Expand food beyond a single type to include meat, grain, and potentially fruits, influencing different aspects of the settlement.
- **New Resource - Guts:** Hunters produce guts, a byproduct of meat production, used by Bowyers and someday for Bard instruments.
- **Mana Quarry:** Introduce a "mana quarry" that produces crystals, a resource for magical units.

## Exploration & World Interaction
- **Fog of War Deck:** Implement a system where exploring units (e.g., rangers) have a chance to discover new tiles like quarries, rivers, or monster lairs.
- **Threat/Danger Ratings:** Introduce a dynamic threat system that increases with expansion or resource extraction, requiring adventurer units to manage.

## Progression & Specialization
- **Specialization Paths:** Define clear paths for units to become specialized (e.g., Fighter, Wizard, Thief, Cleric, Weaponsmith, Armorsmith).
- **Fighter Unlock:** Combine peasant + sword + leather armor to create a fighter. Fighters reduce threat and generate minor gold.
- **Weaponsmith & Rogues:** Weaponsmiths can produce daggers (unlocking rogues) and tools for worker efficiency (with periodic breakage).
- **Bowyer:** Uses wood and guts (from hunters) to produce bows.
- **Farmer & Scribes:** Farmers produce grain and a small amount of hemp (for rope/textiles). Hemp leads to rope and linens. Linens lead to paper, which unlocks scribes.
- **Wizards:** Scribes + towers unlock wizards, who consume scrolls (from scribes) and crystals (from mana quarry) for enchantments.
- **Clerics:** Scribes + church unlock clerics, who provide a buffer against unit death or boost morale/productivity.
- **Party System & Adventures:** Allow creation of "parties" for adventures, yielding significant gold/artifacts or risking loss.

## Environmental & Narrative Elements
- **Weather Cycles:** Implement dynamic weather cycles impacting gameplay.
- **Narrative Seeds in News/Status Log:** Inject story prompts and events into the news feed.
- **Persistent Status Log:** Create a continuous feed for events and news.
- **Quirky Narrative Events:** Include humorous or character-driven events in the newsfeed (e.g., woodsman's daily routine, carpenter's best plank).
- **Fishing:** Introduce fishing as a food gathering activity.

## Design Documents
- **Tech Tree Design Document:** Map out our ideal tech tree.

## UI
- Support modular, continually expanding lists of jobs, resources, and buildings.
